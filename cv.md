About me
--------
After graduating masters in international law, I have worked almost 4 years as a lawyer, then I understand that law is not for me.
I've decided to change my job and to get a new qualification. At first, changing job and getting new knowledge related to IT seemed too difficult,
but I managed those difficulties. I've learned technologies that required from front-end developers, 
and now I'm working at Davr bank as a front-end developer. I am good at working in a team, reviewing big amount of data, making reasonable decisions. 
Upper-intermediate level of english skills is also giving me a chance for comfortable speaking and writing communications. 
I'm always ready for improve and develop my those skills and knowledge and to get new ones.
